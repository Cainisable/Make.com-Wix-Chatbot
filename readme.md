This is a relatively simple chatbot integrated into Wix. It uses a custom ChatGPT Assistant trained on company data to answer customer questions and direct them to booking. This allows for near instantaneous responses of client queries while avoiding the drawbacks of a prebuilt FAQ system. Additionally, it records all messages for future analytical purposes, and utilizes this stored data to maintain consistent ChatGPT threads for each client.
